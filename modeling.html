            <h2>What Is It?</h2>
            <p>Gradual release of responsibility is an instructional framework where the teacher demonstrates a skill, then guides practice, and finally students practice independently. This approach follows the research-proven sequence of explicit instruction followed by scaffolded practice.</p>
            
            <div class="note">
                <strong>Research Base:</strong> This approach is rooted in Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development and has strong evidence for improving student learning across all content areas. Effect size: 0.57 (Hattie's meta-analysis).

            <h3>Example 1: Math Problem</h3>
            
            <h4>I DO (5 minutes):</h4>
            <div class="example-block">
Teacher: "I'm going to solve this problem: 3x + 7 = 22, and I want you to watch how I think through it.

First, I ask myself: What is the question asking me to find? The value of x.

Next, I notice that x is being multiplied by 3, and then 7 is being added. To solve for x, I need to undo those operations in reverse order.

Let me start by subtracting 7 from both sides:
3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7

I'm going to check: does 7 - 7 equal zero? Yes. And 22 - 7 equals 15. So now I have:
3x = 15

Now I need to undo the multiplication. I'll divide both sides by 3:
3x ÷ 3 = 15 ÷ 3

So x = 5.

Last step - and this is important - I'll check my answer by plugging it back in:
3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22 ✓

Did you notice how I worked backwards, undoing each operation?"

            <h4>WE DO (10 minutes):</h4>
            <div class="example-block">
Teacher: "Now let's try one together: 2x - 4 = 10

Turn to your partner: What should we do first? [Students discuss]

[Call on student] 'Add 4 to both sides?' Yes! Why?

Let's all do that on our whiteboards... show me what you get.

[Students hold up whiteboards: 2x = 14]

Good! Now what? [Continue collaborating]"

            <h3>Example 2: Writing (Short Answer Response)</h3>
            
            <h4>I DO (7 minutes):</h4>
            <div class="example-block">
Teacher: "The question asks: Why did the colonists resist British taxation? I need to write a CER response.

First, I'll write my claim - what I believe and can prove:
'The colonists resisted British taxation because they had no say in how taxes were made or used.'

Now I need evidence from the text. Let me look back... [flips through reading]. Here: 'The colonists argued that taxation without representation was tyranny.' I'll write that in quotes with the page number.

For my reasoning, I need to connect my evidence to my claim. Let me think... how does 'taxation without representation' connect to 'no say in taxes'? 

[Writes reasoning while talking]: 'This evidence supports my claim because when the colonists said taxation without representation was tyranny, they meant that Britain was making them pay taxes without giving them any voice in Parliament. They saw this as unfair and undemocratic.'

Does my reasoning explain how my evidence proves my claim? Yes, I think so."

            <h4>WE DO (10 minutes):</h4>
            <div class="example-block">
Teacher: "New question: Why did colonists protest the Stamp Act?

Let's write the claim together. Turn and talk: What's your claim? [Students discuss]

[Call on student] 'They thought it was unfair?' That's a start, but let's make it more specific.

Let's try: 'Colonists protested the Stamp Act because it taxed everyday documents and newspapers, affecting their daily lives.'

Everyone write that claim.

Now, where in the text can we find evidence? I'll give you 2 minutes to find a quote... [circulate and help]"
