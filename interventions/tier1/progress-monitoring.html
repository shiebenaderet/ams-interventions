            <h2>What Is It?</h2>
            <p>Progress monitoring is the regular, systematic checking of student understanding and skill development to make instructional decisions. Rather than waiting for a unit test to discover students haven't learned, progress monitoring provides ongoing feedback that allows teachers to adjust instruction in real-time.</p>
            
            <div class="note">
                <strong>Research Base:</strong> Progress monitoring with feedback has an effect size of 0.70+ (Hattie). When teachers use data to adjust instruction, student achievement increases significantly. This is a cornerstone of effective MTSS implementation.

            <h3>✅ In the Classroom (What TO Do):</h3>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Data collected frequently (weekly or bi-weekly for key skills)</li>
                <li>Data is actually USED to change instruction (not just collected)</li>
                <li>Students can see their own progress over time</li>
                <li>Multiple data sources used (not just tests)</li>
                <li>Quick turnaround on feedback (within 1-2 days)</li>
                <li>Students set goals based on their data</li>
                <li>Decisions are made: Who needs reteaching? Who's ready for enrichment?</li>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Implementation</h2>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Choose What to Monitor (Start Small!)</h3>
            <p>Don't try to monitor everything. Choose 2-3 critical skills in your content area - skills that build over time, not one-time lessons.</p>
            
            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Example for 8th Grade Social Studies:</strong>
• Skill 1: Writing CER (Claim-Evidence-Reasoning) responses
• Skill 2: Analyzing primary sources
• Skill 3: Understanding cause and effect in history
            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Create Simple, Repeatable Assessments</h3>
            <p>For each skill, create a quick check you can give repeatedly:</p>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Same format each time (so growth is clear)</li>
                <li>5-10 minutes maximum</li>
                <li>Easy to score (rubric or right/wrong)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Example CER Rubric (4-point scale):</strong>
4 - Clear claim, specific evidence with citation, reasoning connects evidence to claim
3 - Clear claim, evidence present, reasoning needs development
2 - Claim present, evidence missing OR reasoning missing
1 - Incomplete response
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Build Monitoring into Your Routine</h3>
            
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Day</th>
                        <th>Progress Monitoring Activity</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Monday</strong></td>
                        <td>Bellwork: Analyze a primary source (track on chart)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Wednesday</strong></td>
                        <td>Exit ticket: Write claim based on day's lesson</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Friday</strong></td>
                        <td>Weekly Quiz: 1 CER response + 2 multiple choice on week's content</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Step 4: Track Data Visually</h3>
            
            <h4>Option A: Class Data Tracker (Teacher Use)</h4>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Spreadsheet with student names and weekly scores</li>
                <li>Color-code: Green (mastery), Yellow (approaching), Red (needs support)</li>
                <li>Use to form small groups</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Option B: Student Data Tracker (Student Use)</h4>
            <div class="example-block">
<strong>My CER Writing Progress</strong>

Week 1: 2/4
Week 2: 2/4  
Week 3: 3/4  ← I'm improving!
Week 4: 3/4
Week 5: ?
Week 6: ? 

Goal: 4/4 by end of unit
            </div>

            <h3>Step 5: Use Data to Make Decisions</h3>
            
            <p><strong>After Each Data Collection, Ask:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Who mastered it? (These students need enrichment)</li>
                <li>Who is close? (These students need targeted practice)</li>
                <li>Who is struggling? (These students need reteaching/intervention)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Then Take Action:</strong></p>
            <ul class="features">
                <li><strong>Small Group Reteach</strong> (next day, 10 min): Pull struggling students, reteach</li>
                <li><strong>Peer Tutoring:</strong> Pair mastery students with those who are close</li>
                <li><strong>Adjust Whole Class Instruction:</strong> If 70%+ struggled, reteach to everyone</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Example Decision Making:</strong>

Friday's quiz results:
• CER Responses: 60% of students scored 2/4 or below
• Decision: Monday's lesson will review evidence selection and reasoning

Week 4 data shows:
• 8 students consistently scoring 1-2/4 on CER responses
• Decision: These 8 students get Tier 2 intervention (writing group with counselor or support teacher)

<strong>Teacher:</strong> "Yes! What helped you improve?"

<strong>Student:</strong> "Using the sentence frames for reasoning."

<strong>Teacher:</strong> "Excellent. To get to a 4, what do you need to work on?"

<strong>Student:</strong> "Finding better evidence from the text."

<strong>Teacher:</strong> "Right. Let's set a goal: By next Friday's quiz, find at least 2 pieces of evidence before choosing the best one. I'll check in with you Wednesday."

            <h3>The 3-Question Decision Framework</h3>
            <p>After collecting data, ask these three questions:</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>1. Is my instruction working?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If 70%+ students show mastery → Keep going, add enrichment</li>
                    <li>If 50-69% show mastery → Review key concepts, continue practice</li>
                    <li>If <50% show mastery → Reteach using different approach</li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong>2. Who needs what?</strong>

                <ul>
                    <li>Whole class instruction? (If most students struggling)</li>
                    <li>Small group interventions? (If subset struggling)</li>
                    <li>Pacing? (Too fast/slow based on mastery rate)</li>
                    <li>Assessment format? (Maybe students know it but can't show it this way)</li>
