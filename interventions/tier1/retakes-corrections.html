            <h2>What Quality Implementation Looks Like</h2>

            <h3>✅ In the Classroom (What TO Do):</h3>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Clear policy communicated at start of year (who, when, how)</li>
                <li>Students must show evidence of learning before retake (not just guessing again)</li>
                <li>Retakes assess same skills, but different questions</li>
                <li>Process is efficient for teacher (not overwhelming)</li>
                <li>Students take ownership (they initiate, not teacher chasing them)</li>
                <li>Builds growth mindset: Learning continues after the test</li>

                <ul>

                    <li>Exact same test given again (students memorize answers, don't learn)</li>
                    <li>No requirement to study/relearn before retake</li>
                    <li>Unlimited retakes (becomes gaming the system)</li>
                    <li>Only "good" students allowed to retake</li>
                    <li>Teacher resentment because policy is too burdensome</li>

            <h2>Implementation Steps</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Establish Clear Policy</h3>
            <p><strong>(Communicate Early and Often)</strong></p>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Sample Policy for Middle School:</strong>

RETAKE POLICY - Mr. B's Social Studies

<strong>WHO:</strong> Any student scoring below 80% on a quiz or test

<strong>WHEN:</strong> Within 1 week of receiving graded assessment back

<strong>REQUIREMENTS BEFORE RETAKE:</strong>
1. Complete Test Corrections Form (analyze errors)
2. Attend Retake Review Session (office hours or lunch)
3. Submit Retake Request Form (signed by student and parent)

<strong>THE RETAKE:</strong>
- Similar questions, different content
- Same format (if original was multiple choice + short answer, retake will be too)
- Taken during office hours, lunch, or before/after school

<strong>GRADING:</strong>
- Retake grade replaces original grade up to 80%
- If you score below original, original grade stands
- You get ONE retake per assessment

<strong>EXAMPLE:</strong>
Original grade: 65%
After corrections and review, retake grade: 85%
Final grade: 80% (capped)
            </div>

            <p><strong>Post this policy:</strong></p>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>On Canvas</li>
                <li>On classroom wall</li>
                <li>In syllabus sent home</li>
                <li>Review it before first assessment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Create Efficient Systems</h3>

            <h4>Tool 1: Test Corrections Form</h4>
            <div class="data-tracker">
Name: _______________ Assessment: _______________

For each question you missed:

Question #: _____

[Repeat for each missed question]

What is my study plan before the retake?

2. _______________
3. _______________
            </div>

            <h4>Tool 2: Retake Request Form</h4>
            <div class="data-tracker">
RETAKE REQUEST FORM

Student Name: _________________ Date: _________
Assessment: ________________________

            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Require Learning Before Retake</h3>

            <h4>Option 1: Retake Review Session (Most Effective)</h4>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Offer 2-3 times per week (e.g., Monday/Wednesday lunch)</li>
                <li>Students attend with their corrections form</li>
                <li>Mini-reteach of commonly missed concepts (10 min)</li>
                <li>Students study/ask questions (15 min)</li>
                <li>Students can take retake at end of session OR schedule for later</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Option 2: Differentiated Review Assignment</h4>
            <p>Based on Test Corrections Form, assign targeted practice:</p>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Missed vocabulary questions? → Complete vocabulary review worksheet</li>
                <li>Missed cause/effect questions? → Complete cause/effect graphic organizer</li>
                <li>Missed evidence-based questions? → Practice CER responses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Students submit this review work before retake</p>

            <h4>Option 3: Student-Led Study Plan</h4>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Student proposes their own study plan based on errors</li>
                <li>Must include: What I'll study, how I'll study it, when I'll study</li>
                <li>Teacher approves plan</li>
                <li>Student shows evidence of completing plan (notes, practice, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Making Retakes Logistically Manageable</h2>

            <h3>For Teachers:</h3>

            <h4>Batch Retakes:</h4>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Don't offer retakes daily (you'll be overwhelmed)</li>
                <li>Set specific retake times: "Retakes available Monday lunch, Wednesday after school, Friday before school"</li>
                <li>Multiple students can retake at once (different assessments)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Use Student Helpers:</h4>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Responsible student can proctor retake while you work with others</li>
                <li>Older student aid can supervise (if available)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Digital Retakes:</h4>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Use Google Forms or Canvas quizzes for multiple choice</li>
                <li>You review short answers</li>
                <li>Reduces printing and grading time</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Track Retakes:</h4>
            <p>Simple spreadsheet:</p>
            <div class="data-tracker">
Student | Original Test | Original Score | Corrections Submitted? | Review Attended? | Retake Date | Retake Score | Final Grade
Maria   | Unit 3        | 68%           | Yes                   | Yes, 10/15      | 10/18      | 78%         | 78%

                    <ul>
