            <h2>What Is It?</h2>
            <p>IEP (Individualized Education Program) and 504 accommodations are legally mandated supports for students with documented disabilities. These are not optional interventions - they are federal civil rights protections under IDEA (for IEPs) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (for 504 Plans). Accommodations are changes in HOW a student accesses learning, not WHAT they learn. These supports level the playing field so students with disabilities can demonstrate their knowledge and skills.</p>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>LEGAL REQUIREMENT:</strong> IEP and 504 accommodations are not suggestions or best practices - they are legal mandates. Failure to implement accommodations as written can result in violations of federal law, discrimination complaints, and legal consequences for the school and individual staff members. When in doubt, implement the accommodation and consult with your case manager or administrator.
            </div>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Important Distinction:</strong> This is a Tier 3 intervention because it applies to individual students with documented disabilities (approximately 13-15% of students nationally). However, many Tier 1 and Tier 2 strategies benefit all students and may be similar to accommodations - the key difference is that IEP/504 accommodations are individualized, legally required, and documented in a formal plan.

                    <li><strong>Before creating the assignment, ask:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Which students need extended time? → Plan testing schedule accordingly</li>
                            <li>Which students need text-to-speech? → Ensure digital version available</li>
                            <li>Which students need small group testing? → Reserve space and proctor</li>
                            <li>Which students need visual supports? → Create graphic organizer in advance</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Universal Design approach:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make accommodations available to all students when possible</li>
                            <li>Example: If Student A needs text-to-speech, provide digital version for everyone</li>
                            <li>This reduces stigma and benefits more students</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Implement Accommodations Consistently</h3>

            <h4>Tests & Quizzes</h4>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Scenario: You're giving a 30-minute quiz</strong>

<strong>Students with extended time (1.5x):</strong>
- Will need 45 minutes
- Plan: Start quiz at same time, but let them continue while others move to next activity
- OR: Pull them 15 min before class ends so they finish with class

<strong>Students with small group testing:</strong>
- Arrange testing location in advance (resource room, back table, counselor office)
- Provide copy of quiz to proctor if needed
- Ensure student knows where to go

<strong>Students with text-to-speech:</strong>
- Provide digital version of quiz (Google Form, PDF)
- Ensure student has headphones
- Test technology before quiz starts
            </div>

            <h4>Daily Assignments</h4>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Scenario: Students are writing an essay</strong>

<strong>Student with speech-to-text:</strong>
- Provide access to device with dictation software
- Allow student to verbally compose essay
- Student may need headphones/quiet space

<strong>Student with graphic organizer:</strong>
- Provide pre-made graphic organizer to plan essay
- May be same organizer you show whole class, but printed for their reference

<strong>Student with breaks:</strong>
- Allow student to take 5-min breaks as needed
- Student might stand, walk to water fountain, stretch
- No permission needed - accommodation says "as needed"
            </div>

            <h3>Step 4: Document Implementation</h3>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>Legal Protection:</strong> If there's ever a question about whether accommodations were provided, documentation is your evidence. Keep records of when and how accommodations were implemented.
            </div>

            <div class="protocol-box">
                <h4>What to Document:</h4>
                <ul class="features">
                    <li><strong>For tests/major assignments:</strong> Note which accommodations were provided
                        <ul>
                            <li>In gradebook: "Extended time provided"</li>
                            <li>On student's test: Checkmark or note</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>If accommodation can't be provided:</strong> Document why and what alternative was offered
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: "Small group testing unavailable due to no proctor - offered individual testing in hallway instead"</li>
                            <li>Notify case manager immediately</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>If student refuses accommodation:</strong> Document and notify case manager
                        <ul>
                            <li>Student has right to refuse, but accommodation should always be offered</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 5: Communicate with Case Manager</h3>

            <div class="protocol-box">
                <h4>When to Contact Case Manager:</h4>
                <ul class="features">
                    <li>✓ You don't understand what an accommodation means or how to implement it</li>
                    <li>✓ An accommodation isn't working or student isn't using it</li>
                    <li>✓ You think student needs a different/additional accommodation</li>
                    <li>✓ You're unable to provide an accommodation as written</li>
                    <li>✓ Student's needs have changed significantly</li>
                    <li>✓ Parent/student questions the accommodations</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Don't:</strong> Change, add, or remove accommodations without IEP/504 team meeting. Only the team can modify the plan.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 6: Monitor Effectiveness</h3>

            <p><strong>Accommodations should help student access learning. If not, team needs to know.</strong></p>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Questions to Ask:</strong>
- Is student using the accommodation?
- Is the accommodation helping student demonstrate knowledge?
- Is student's performance improving with accommodation?
- Does student need additional support?

<strong>Example:</strong>
Student has "extended time" accommodation but still doesn't finish tests.
→ Contact case manager: "Student A uses extended time (1.5x) but still only completes 60% of test. Should we discuss 2x time or other accommodations at next IEP meeting?"

This is valuable data for the IEP/504 team!
