            <h2>What Is It?</h2>
            <p>Modified rubrics are scaffolded assessment tools that provide additional structure and support while maintaining the same learning standards as general education rubrics. Unlike accommodations that change how a student accesses content, modified rubrics provide temporary scaffolds that fade over time as students build skills. This is a Tier 2 intervention because it targets specific students who need additional support to demonstrate their learning.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Research Base:</strong> Scaffolded assessments have an effect size of 0.82 (Hattie), making them one of the most powerful interventions for student achievement. The key is that scaffolds are temporary - they're designed to build independence, not create dependency. Modified rubrics help students understand expectations while building the skills to meet those expectations independently.
            </div>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Key Principle:</strong> Modified rubrics are NOT "easier" or "less rigorous." They provide the same end goal with additional structure, examples, and checkpoints. The goal is for students to eventually use the general education rubric independently.

            <h2>What Quality Implementation Looks Like</h2>

            <h3>✅ In the Classroom (What TO Do):</h3>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Modified rubric maintains the <strong>same learning standards</strong> as general rubric</li>
                <li>Scaffolds are <strong>explicit and visible</strong> (students know what extra support they're getting)</li>
                <li>Scaffolds are <strong>temporary</strong> - plan includes fading support over time</li>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Implementation</h2>

            <h3>Phase 1: Identify Need (Before Creating Modified Rubric)</h3>

            <h4>Step 1: Analyze Student Performance Data</h4>
            <p><strong>Don't modify without data! Understand WHY the student is struggling.</strong></p>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Example - Writing Assignment:</strong>
Student scores consistently low on writing rubric.
Look at patterns:
- Does student struggle with ALL criteria equally? → May need writing intervention (Tier 3)
- Does student score low on "organization" but well on "ideas"? → Scaffolded rubric for organization
- Does student write very little or seem overwhelmed? → Checklist format to break down task
- Is student ELL or struggle with academic language? → Sentence frames

<strong>Decision:</strong> Based on pattern, student needs scaffolded support for "organization" criterion specifically.
            </div>

            <h4>Step 2: Determine Which Modification Type Fits the Need</h4>

            <div class="protocol-box">
                <h4>Decision Tree:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>If student understands task but struggles with complexity:</strong> → Scaffolded Criteria</li>
                    <li><strong>If student doesn't understand what quality looks like:</strong> → Exemplars Embedded</li>
                    <li><strong>If student has language barriers:</strong> → Sentence Frames</li>
                    <li><strong>If student has executive functioning/organization issues:</strong> → Checklist Format</li>
                    <li><strong>If student is overwhelmed by multiple criteria:</strong> → Reduced Complexity</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 2: Create the Modified Rubric</h3>

            <h4>Step 3: Build the Scaffold While Maintaining Standards</h4>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Original Rubric (Science Lab Report - Organization Criterion):</strong>

<strong>Level 4:</strong> Lab report is exceptionally well-organized with clear sections
<strong>Level 3:</strong> Lab report is organized with identifiable sections
<strong>Level 2:</strong> Lab report has some organization but sections unclear
<strong>Level 1:</strong> Lab report lacks organization

<strong>Modified Rubric (Scaffolded Criteria):</strong>

<strong>Level 4 - All sections present and complete (4 pts):</strong>
☐ Question clearly stated
☐ Hypothesis with "if...then..." format
☐ Materials list (complete)
☐ Procedure (numbered steps)
☐ Data table (labeled)
☐ Conclusion answers question

<strong>Level 3 - Most sections present (3 pts):</strong>
5 of 6 sections above completed

<strong>Level 2 - Some sections present (2 pts):</strong>
3-4 of 6 sections above completed

<strong>Level 1 - Few sections present (1 pt):</strong>
0-2 sections completed

<strong>Note:</strong> Same standard (organization), but scaffolded into explicit checklist
            </div>

            <h4>Step 4: Add Visual Supports</h4>

            <ul class="features">
                <li><strong>Color-coding:</strong> Highlight different sections or criteria in different colors</li>
                <li><strong>Icons:</strong> Add visual markers (✓ for checklist items, ⭐ for highest level)</li>
                <li><strong>Progress bars:</strong> Show how close student is to each level</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Include side-by-side comparison of Level 2 vs Level 4 work</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 3: Teach Students to Use Modified Rubric</h3>

            <h4>Step 5: Explicit Instruction on Rubric Use</h4>
            <p><strong>Don't just hand it out - TEACH students how to use it!</strong></p>

            <div class="protocol-box">
                <h4>Mini-Lesson on Using Modified Rubric (15 minutes):</h4>

                <strong>1. Explain the Purpose (3 min):</strong>
                <p>"This rubric is designed to help you understand exactly what I'm looking for in your lab report. It breaks down 'organization' into specific things you need to include. Let's look at it together."</p>

                <strong>2. Walk Through Each Section (5 min):</strong>
                <p>"For Level 4, you need all six sections. Let me show you what each one means..."<br>
                [Go through each checklist item with example]</p>

                <strong>3. Practice with Sample Work (5 min):</strong>
                <p>"Here's a sample lab report. Let's use the rubric to score it together. First, check if there's a clear question..."<br>
                [Model using the checklist to evaluate work]</p>

                <strong>4. Self-Assessment (2 min):</strong>
                <p>"Before you turn in your work, you'll use this rubric to score yourself. This helps you check if you've included everything."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 4: Fade the Scaffold Over Time</h3>

            <h4>Step 6: Plan for Gradual Release</h4>
            <p><strong>Modified rubrics are a bridge, not a permanent accommodation!</strong></p>

            <div class="data-tracker">
<strong>Fading Plan Example (8-Week Timeline):</strong>

<strong>Weeks 1-2: Full Scaffold</strong>
- Student uses modified rubric with all scaffolds
- Teacher provides explicit instruction on each criterion
- Student self-assesses using checklist before submitting
→ Goal: Student scores Level 3 or higher using scaffold

<strong>Weeks 3-4: Partial Scaffold</strong>
- Remove some checklist items (keep the hardest ones)
- Student fills in removed items from memory
- Teacher provides feedback on use of rubric
→ Goal: Student can identify 80% of criteria independently

<strong>Weeks 5-6: Minimal Scaffold</strong>
- Provide only rubric categories (no checklist details)
- Student creates own checklist from categories
- Teacher reviews student-created checklist for accuracy
→ Goal: Student demonstrates understanding of expectations

<strong>Weeks 7-8: Standard Rubric</strong>
- Student uses general education rubric
- Teacher monitors for continued success
- Scaffold available as reference if needed
→ Goal: Student independently uses standard rubric
            </div>

            <h4>Step 7: Monitor Progress Toward Independence</h4>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Progress Monitoring Questions:</strong>
- Is student's score improving over time?
- Can student explain what each rubric level means?
- Does student use rubric for self-assessment before submitting work?
- Can student identify what level their work meets?
- Is student ready for less scaffolding?

<strong>Data to Track:</strong>
Week 1: Used full scaffold → scored 3/4
Week 3: Used full scaffold → scored 4/4 (ready to fade!)
Week 5: Used partial scaffold → scored 3/4
Week 7: Used standard rubric → scored 3/4 (SUCCESS!)

"Hello [Parent],

I wanted to share a support strategy I'm using with [Student] for writing assignments. I've created a modified rubric that breaks down the writing expectations into more specific, concrete steps. This helps [Student] understand exactly what's expected and check their own work before submitting.

This is a temporary scaffold - as [Student] becomes more confident with the writing process, we'll gradually remove the extra support. I'm seeing great progress already!

The modified rubric doesn't change the learning standards - [Student] is working toward the same goals as the rest of the class, just with additional structure to support success.

Please let me know if you have any questions!"

            <h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Create Your First Modified Rubric:</h3>

                <strong>Step 1: Identify Student (10 min)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Look at recent assessment data</li>
                    <li>☐ Which student consistently scores low on same rubric criterion?</li>
                    <li>☐ What specifically are they struggling with?</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Step 2: Choose Modification Type (5 min)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Review types of modifications table above</li>
                    <li>☐ Select the type that matches student's specific struggle</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Step 3: Create Modified Version (15 min)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Take your existing rubric</li>
                    <li>☐ Add appropriate scaffold (checklist, frames, exemplars, etc.)</li>
                    <li>☐ Ensure standards remain the same</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Step 4: Teach Student to Use It (15 min)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Meet with student to explain rubric</li>
                    <li>☐ Practice using it on sample work</li>
                    <li>☐ Have student try self-assessment</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Step 5: Monitor & Fade (Ongoing)</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>☐ Track student scores over time</li>
                    <li>☐ After 3-4 successful uses, begin fading scaffold</li>
                    <li>☐ Transition to standard rubric within 6-8 weeks</li>
                </ul>
