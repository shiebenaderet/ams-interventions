            <h2>What Is It?</h2>
            <p>Frequent check-ins are brief, structured conversations between teacher and student(s) to monitor progress, provide encouragement, address concerns, and adjust support as needed. Unlike casual conversations, these check-ins are intentional, scheduled, and focused on specific goals - whether academic, behavioral, or social-emotional.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Research Base:</strong> Check-in/Check-out (CICO) interventions have strong research support, with effect sizes ranging from 0.60-0.80 for reducing problem behavior and improving academic engagement. Regular check-ins build relationships, increase accountability, and allow for rapid response when students struggle.

            <h2>What Quality Implementation Looks Like</h2>

            <h3>✅ What TO Do:</h3>
            <ul class="features">
                <li><strong>Scheduled consistently</strong> - same time, same place (e.g., every morning at 8:05, every Friday after 4th period)</li>
                <li><strong>Brief and focused</strong> - 2-5 minutes maximum</li>
                <li><strong>Specific goals</strong> - checking on clear, defined targets (not just "how are you?")</li>
                <li><strong>Data-driven</strong> - use a simple rating system or checklist</li>
                <li><strong>Positive and encouraging</strong> - start with strengths, end with next step</li>
                <li><strong>Two-way conversation</strong> - student reflects, not just teacher talking</li>
                <li><strong>Follow-through</strong> - if student needs something, you address it</li>
                <li><strong>Record-keeping</strong> - track patterns over time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>❌ Red Flags:</h3>
            <div class="warning">
                <ul>
                    <li>Check-ins happen "when there's time" (no schedule = won't happen)</li>
                    <li>Conversations are too long (10+ minutes, becomes unsustainable)</li>
                    <li>No clear purpose or goal ("Just checking in...")</li>
                    <li>Focus only on problems, not progress</li>

                    <li>Check-ins used as punishment or interrogation</li>

Student: "Maybe a 7."
Teacher: "That's higher than usual. What's going on?"

            <h3>Phase 1: Identify Students and Set Goals (Week 1)</h3>

            <h4>Step 1: Determine Who Needs Check-Ins</h4>
            <p><strong>Use data to identify:</strong></p>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Students with multiple missing assignments (3+)</li>
                <li>Students with behavior referrals (2+ in a month)</li>
                <li>Students whose grades dropped suddenly</li>
                <li>Students who seem disengaged or withdrawn</li>
                <li>Students returning from absence (illness, suspension)</li>
                <li>Students experiencing known stressors (family, social)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Start small:</strong> Choose 2-4 students maximum if you're doing individual check-ins

            <ul class="features">
                <li>Morning: Before classes start</li>
                <li>Passing period: Between specific classes</li>

                    <h3>❌ Pitfall: Check-Ins Feel Like Punishment</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Student sees check-ins as "being in trouble"</p>
                    <p><strong>✅ Solution:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Frame positively: "I'm checking in because I know you can be successful"</li>
                        <li>Start and end with positives</li>
                        <li>Use neutral time/location</li>
                        <li>Celebrate successes publicly, struggles privately</li>

                    <h3>❌ Pitfall: Check-Ins Are Inconsistent</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Sometimes daily, sometimes skip a week</p>
                    <p><strong>✅ Solution:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Set alarm/reminder on phone</li>
                        <li>Block time in calendar (non-negotiable)</li>
                        <li>Have backup: If you're absent, who does check-in?</li>
                        <li>Track: Keep log of when check-ins happen</li>

                    <h3>❌ Pitfall: Check-Ins Become Too Long</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> 10-15 minute conversations are unsustainable</p>
                    <p><strong>✅ Solution:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use timer (set for 3 minutes)</li>
                        <li>Stick to structure: Review → Celebrate → Plan → Done</li>
                        <li>If deeper conversation needed, schedule separate time</li>

                    <h3>❌ Pitfall: No Data = No Accountability</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Just having conversations with no tracking</p>
                    <p><strong>✅ Solution:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use simple tracking sheet (daily points, weekly yes/no)</li>

                        <li>Without data, you can't tell if it's working</li>

                    <h3>❌ Pitfall: Goals Are Too Vague</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> "Try harder" or "do better" - not measurable</p>
                    <p><strong>✅ Solution:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make goals specific and measurable</li>

            <h2>Remember</h2>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p>Check-ins are about <strong>relationship, accountability, and responsiveness.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> You care enough to check in consistently</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Student knows someone is paying attention</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> You adjust support based on what you see</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When done well, check-ins are one of the most impactful Tier 2 interventions because they combine data, relationships, and timely support.</p>
