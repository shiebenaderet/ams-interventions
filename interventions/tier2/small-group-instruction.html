            <h2>What Is It?</h2>
            <p>Small group instruction is targeted teaching provided to a subset of students who need additional support to master specific skills or concepts. Unlike whole-class instruction, small groups allow for more intensive teaching, immediate feedback, and instruction precisely matched to student needs. This is a cornerstone of Tier 2 intervention.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Research Base:</strong> Small group instruction has an effect size of 0.49 (Hattie), meaning it can accelerate learning by nearly half a year's growth. When groups are formed based on specific skill needs and instruction is targeted, the effect size increases to 0.60+. This is particularly effective when combined with progress monitoring.

            <h2>What Quality Implementation Looks Like</h2>

            <h3>✅ In the Classroom (What TO Do):</h3>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Groups are formed based on <strong>specific skill needs</strong> identified through data</li>
                <li>Groups are <strong>flexible</strong> - students move in and out as they demonstrate mastery</li>
                <li>Instruction is <strong>targeted</strong> to the specific skill gap, not just "easier" work</li>
                <li>Groups meet <strong>consistently</strong> - scheduled into the week (not sporadic)</li>
                <li>Teacher provides <strong>immediate, corrective feedback</strong></li>
                <li>Other students have <strong>meaningful independent work</strong> during small group time</li>
                <li>Groups are <strong>temporary</strong> - 4-8 weeks for most skills</li>
                <li><strong>Progress monitoring</strong> happens within the group to track growth</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>❌ Red Flags (What NOT to Do):</h3>
            <div class="warning">
                <ul>
                    <li>Static groups that never change (same students all year)</li>
                    <li>Groups based on "high/medium/low" rather than specific skills</li>
                    <li>Small group gets same instruction as whole class, just repeated</li>
                    <li>Groups meet "when there's time" with no consistent schedule</li>
                    <li>Teacher works with one group while other students are off-task</li>
                    <li>No data used to form groups or track progress</li>
                    <li>Groups become permanent "ability groups" that stigmatize students</li>
                    <li>Small group work is just easier/less work, not targeted teaching</li>

            <h2>When to Use Small Group Instruction</h2>

            <h3>Ideal Candidates for Tier 2 Small Groups:</h3>

            <h4>Academic Indicators:</h4>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Scoring 40-70% on grade-level assessments</li>
                <li>Showing gaps in specific skills (e.g., can decode but struggles with comprehension)</li>
                <li>Making progress but not keeping pace with peers</li>
                <li>Need more practice and support than Tier 1 provides</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Behavioral/Engagement Indicators:</h4>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Needs more teacher proximity and attention</li>
                <li>Benefits from smaller, less distracting setting</li>
                <li>Needs more opportunities to respond and practice</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>NOT Good Candidates:</h4>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Students scoring above 70% (they don't need Tier 2)</li>
                <li>Students scoring below 30% consistently (may need Tier 3)</li>
                <li>Students who need accommodation, not different instruction (they may just need Tier 1 accommodations)</li>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Implementation</h2>

            <h3>Phase 1: Forming Groups (Week 1)</h3>

            <h4>Step 1: Analyze Data to Identify Skill Gaps</h4>
            <p><strong>Don't just look at grades - identify the SPECIFIC skill.</strong></p>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Example - Math:</strong>
- Quiz shows 8 students scored 50-65%
- Analyze errors: What specific skills are they missing?
  * 5 students: Struggle with multi-step problems
  * 3 students: Struggle with negative numbers
- Form 2 groups based on these specific needs

<strong>Example - ELA:</strong>
- Reading assessment shows 10 students below proficient
- Analyze: What's the barrier?
  * 4 students: Decoding/fluency issues
  * 6 students: Comprehension (can read but don't understand)
- Form 2 groups with different instructional focus
            </div>

            <h4>Step 2: Determine Group Size and Meeting Frequency</h4>

            <p><strong>Group Size Guidelines:</strong></p>
            <ul class="features">
                <li><strong>3-4 students:</strong> Intensive skill work, maximum teacher interaction</li>
                <li><strong>5-6 students:</strong> Balanced - enough interaction, not too intensive</li>
                <li><strong>7+ students:</strong> Too large for Tier 2 (becomes mini whole-class lesson)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Meeting Frequency:</strong></p>
            <ul class="features">
                <li><strong>Daily (20 min):</strong> Intensive skills like reading, math facts</li>
                <li><strong>3x/week (25-30 min):</strong> Most academic skills</li>
                <li><strong>2x/week (30 min):</strong> Minimum for measurable progress</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Step 3: Schedule Small Group Time</h4>

            <div class="protocol-box">
                <h4>Option A: During Whole Class Independent Work</h4>
                <p>Lesson Structure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>0-15 min: Whole class mini-lesson</li>
                    <li>15-45 min: Independent work begins → Teacher pulls Group A (15 min)</li>
                    <li>30-45 min: Continue independent work → Teacher pulls Group B (15 min)</li>
                    <li>45-50 min: Whole class closure</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="protocol-box">
                <h4>Option B: Station Rotation</h4>
                <p>Students rotate every 15 minutes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Station 1: Teacher-led small group (targeted instruction)</li>
                    <li>Station 2: Independent practice (reinforcement)</li>
                    <li>Station 3: Partner work (collaborative)</li>
                    <li>Station 4: Technology/game (engagement)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Step 4: Plan Targeted Instruction</h4>
            <p><strong>The instruction must be DIFFERENT and TARGETED, not just "easier."</strong></p>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Example - Reading Comprehension Group:</strong>
- Don't: Give them an easier book and same questions
- Do: Teach a specific comprehension strategy they're missing
  * Week 1-2: Making inferences (with explicit teaching and practice)
  * Week 3-4: Finding text evidence to support inferences
  * Week 5-6: Applying both skills to grade-level text

<strong>Key Components of Small Group Lesson:</strong>
1. Quick review (2-3 min): Recap previous learning
2. Targeted teaching (8-10 min): Focus on ONE skill
3. Guided practice (8-10 min): Students practice with immediate feedback
4. Check for understanding (2-3 min): Quick assessment/exit ticket
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 2: Running Small Groups (Weeks 2-6)</h3>

            <h4>Managing the Rest of the Class</h4>
            <p><strong>The #1 reason small groups fail: Other students are off-task and disruptive</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>

            <ul class="features">
                <li><strong>Teach Independence Before Starting Small Groups</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Week 1: Practice independent work routines</li>
                        <li>Model: What to do if stuck (3 before me: check notes, ask partner, try)</li>
                        <li>Model: What to do when finished early</li>
                        <li>Practice: 10-minute independent work with teacher observing</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Structure Independent Work Strategically</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meaningful, not busy work: Practice what they learned in Tier 1</li>
                        <li>Appropriate difficulty: Should be able to do independently (80%+ success rate)</li>
                        <li>Self-checking when possible: Answer keys, self-grading quizzes</li>
                        <li>Choice: "You must do #1-5, then choose 3 more from #6-12"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Small Group Lesson Structure</h4>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>15-Minute Group Format:</strong>

<strong>Minutes 0-2: Check-In & Review</strong>
Teacher: "Show me your exit ticket from yesterday on your whiteboard."
[Students hold up - teacher scans for understanding]
Teacher: "Great! I see most of you remembered how to find the main idea.
Today we're going to work on finding supporting details."

<strong>Minutes 3-10: Targeted Teaching</strong>
Teacher: "I'm going to show you my strategy for finding supporting details..."
[Models with think-aloud on short passage]

Teacher: "Now let's try one together..."
[Guided practice - students contribute, teacher facilitates]
[Do 2-3 examples together with decreasing support]

<strong>Minutes 11-14: You Try</strong>
Teacher: "Now you try independently. I'll be watching and helping."
[Students work on passage]
[Teacher circulates, gives immediate feedback to each student]

<strong>Minutes 14-15: Quick Exit Ticket</strong>
Teacher: "On your whiteboard, write one supporting detail from this paragraph."
[Students write and hold up]
Teacher: [Scans responses, notes who's ready, who needs more practice]
"Excellent! Tomorrow we'll practice finding multiple supporting details."
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 3: Progress Monitoring & Adjusting (Ongoing)</h3>

            <h4>Monitor Progress Weekly</h4>
            <p><strong>Don't wait for unit test to see if it's working!</strong></p>

            <div class="example-block">
<strong>Example - Math Problem Solving Group:</strong>

Week 1: 2/5 correct on multi-step problems
Week 2: 2/5 correct (no growth - adjust instruction)
Week 3: 3/5 correct (progress!)
Week 4: 4/5 correct (good growth)
Week 5: 4/5 correct (ready to exit? Give harder problems)
Week 6: 5/5 correct on grade-level problems (EXIT GROUP)
            </div>

            <h4>When to Exit Students from Small Groups</h4>
            <p><strong>Exit Criteria (Meet at least 2 of these):</strong></p>
            <ul class="features">
                <li>Scoring 70%+ on grade-level tasks for 2 consecutive weeks</li>
                <li>Can complete Tier 1 work independently without struggle</li>
                <li>Progress monitoring shows consistent mastery</li>
                <li>Teacher observation: Student no longer needs extra support</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Remember: Exiting is SUCCESS, not failure!</strong>
